  <h2>Field of Study</h2>
  <p>I completed my first year at the University of Delaware as a Computer Science major before transferring to the University of Pittsburgh to start my second year. I am now in my third year of college, pursuing a Digital Narrative & Interactive Design major with a Computer Science minor. Transferring allowed me time to reflect on my year and whether I wanted to continue in the Computer Science field. I realized that while I enjoyed coding, problem solving, and creating projects, I did not want to be just a programmer. Instead, my interests are more aligned in the design process of making and communicating. I decided to pusue DNID because of this emphasis on interaction between digital technology and humans.<br><br>The class I have enjoyed most so far is Narrative and Technology which covered various media and analyzed how a narrative's medium affects the story that is told. From that class, I found interfaces, interactive webtexts, and video games to be most interesting. Currently, I am enrolled in Interactive Literature and DNID (the class) where I look forward to both analyzing works of interactive media and designing my own.</p>

  <h2>Knowledge, Tools, and Skills</h2>
    <p>I have some experience with Adobe software, like Photoshop and Audition, from previous design classes. Additionally, I have coding experience in languages including Python, Java, C, and HTML. I enjoy projects that incorporate elements of coding with design, such as websites and interactive stories, and am interested in how interactivity can influence user experience. I look forward to learning other skills in this class as well, including Special Effects and Animation in Adobe.</p>

  <h2>Potential Project</h2>
      <p>I enjoy reading books, playing board games, completing puzzles, and writing/sending letters. I collect CDs, records, and books. In general, I am into physical media. I think it is interesting how often physical media becomes obsolete in the face of newer or faster digital technologies and, as a lover of old things, I wonder why newer is often assumed to be better. I would be interested in doing a project on this subject. Potentially questioning where physical media stands in a mostly digital world and if/how digital and physical media may interact, maybe honing in on certain media in particular.</p>

<!-- After school what kind of job or career would you like to pursue? What is your reasoning for going on this path?

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
   <h2>In the Future</h2>
      <p>After school, I would be interested in doing web design, UX design, or creating other interactive media to connect to my interests in coding and design. I hope many of the projects I work on in school will build my experience and portfolio as well as help to narrow exactly what kind of work I want to do. </p>
